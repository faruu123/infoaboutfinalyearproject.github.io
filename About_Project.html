        <h1>Types of Blockchain Project !</h1>
        <p>Cryptocurrency markets are volatile, therefore, most market-watchers could be focusing on that. However, the underlying blockchain technology has come off its’ own now. The global market for the blockchain technology will amount to US $ 2.3 billion in 2021, as this Statista report states.
		<br>
		<br>
		Blockchain use cases now span across multiple industries. For e.g., banks and financial services institutions are using it to improve efficiency. Identity verification, land registry, supply chain assurance, energy trading, simplifying ‘Bill of Lading’ in container shipping, countering digital ad fraud, fighting illegal fishing, etc. are just a few examples
		<br>
		<br>
		The cost of blockchain projects varies depending on what you want to achieve. Broadly, there can be two kinds of blockchain projects, as follows:

        <h2 style="color:red;">How Blockchain Changes the Crowdfunding Game</h2>
        <p>So where does blockchain come in? The natural advantages of blockchain technology can support and improve crowdfunding in several distinct areas:<br></p>
        <h4>Decentralization.</h4>
		<p>The blockchain is completely decentralized. This means it isn’t going to rely on any platform or combination of platforms to enable creators to raise funds. That’s going to have multiple positive effects for the crowdfunding community. For starters, you’ll no longer be beholden to the rules, regulations, and whims of the most popular crowdfunding platforms on the internet. Literally, any project has a chance of getting visibility and getting funded. It also eliminates the problem of fees. While blockchain upkeep does cost a bit of money, you’ll cut back drastically on transaction fees. This makes crowdfunding less expensive for creators and investors.
		<br>
		<br>
		</p>
		<h4>Accessible equity (or something similar).</h4>
		<p>Instead of crowdfunding to enable preorders of upcoming tangible products, blockchain could rely on asset tokenization to provide investors with equity or some similar concept of ownership. For example, an inventor who plans on creating multiple new products with the incoming funds could grant each new investor with a small ownership stake in the company, commensurate with the amount they contribute. That way, investors will see success proportional to the eventual success of the company. This could potentially open whole new worlds of investment opportunity.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>Universal availability.</h4>
		<p>Any project using a blockchain-based crowdfunding model can potentially get funded. Also, any person with an internet connection can contribute to those projects. There may be some demand for discovery and visibility platforms. But, there isn’t a fundamental limitation the way there is for crowdfunding projects today.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>Immediate provision.</h4>
		<p>Blockchain-based crowdfunders wouldn’t have to worry about the “empty promises” that have plagued modern-day crowdfunding projects. Instead of contributing money and waiting weeks or months to receive the promised product they, contributors will immediately receive fractional enterprise or product ownership.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>Flexible options.</h4>
		<p>Using the blockchain as asset tokenization grants creators and entrepreneurs more liberties. They can raise more funds by issuing more fractional shares in their enterprise and use those funds to expand. Yet, they can also leverage those fractional shares directly. For example, they could save money on hiring employees by compensating them partially in fractional ownership of the business, converting it into an employee-owned enterprise. Asset tokens become their own form of currency in this model, enabling organizations to do more like hire professionals like marketers and advertisers.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>Peer to peer exchanges.</h4>
		<p>Just like cryptocurrency today, it’s possible to exchange crowdfunded business or product stakes on a peer-to-peer basis. This provides contributors with more liquidity for their investments. It could serve as a way to generate more interest in the project overall. This change could eventually precipitate the creation of an entirely new type of marketplace.
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
        <h4>Toward a New Era of Crowdfunding</h4>
		<p>It’s no secret that crowdfunding has enormous potential. Even in its current, flawed form, funding is helping new entrepreneurs, inventors, and creators improve the world. In the near future when the blockchain serves as the backbone of democratized investor contributions, it’s going to be even more accessible, secure, and flexible for creators and investors. It’s only a matter of time though the exact length of time is hard to estimate. There are still some challenges to overcome and only so much blockchain talent to go around.
